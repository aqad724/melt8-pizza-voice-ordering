Overview
This is a real-time AI voice application that integrates Twilio's voice services with OpenAI's Realtime API to create an interactive voice assistant. The system allows users to make phone calls and have real-time conversations with an AI agent powered by OpenAI's language model.

User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

System Architecture
Backend Architecture
Framework: FastAPI-based Python web application
Asynchronous Design: Built with async/await patterns to handle concurrent voice streams and WebSocket connections
WebSocket Support: Implements real-time bidirectional communication for voice data streaming
Voice Processing Pipeline
Voice Input: Receives audio through Twilio's telephony infrastructure
Real-time Processing: Uses OpenAI's Realtime API for immediate audio-to-text and text-to-audio conversion
Voice Output: Streams processed audio back through Twilio to the caller
API Structure
REST Endpoints: FastAPI routes for handling HTTP requests
WebSocket Endpoints: Real-time connections for audio streaming
Webhook Integration: Twilio voice webhooks for call handling
Configuration Management
Environment Variables: Uses python-dotenv for secure API key management
Prompt Configuration: Configurable prompt ID and version system for AI behavior customization
Voice Settings: Configurable voice selection (currently set to "alloy")
Event Logging System
Selective Logging: Monitors specific event types including response completion, rate limits, audio buffer events, and session management
Real-time Monitoring: Tracks speech detection, audio processing, and session lifecycle events
External Dependencies
Core Services
OpenAI Realtime API: Primary AI processing engine for voice-to-voice conversations
Twilio Voice API: Telephony infrastructure for handling phone calls and audio streaming
Python Libraries
FastAPI: Web framework for building the API server
websockets: WebSocket client/server implementation for real-time communication
twilio: Official Twilio SDK for voice response handling and TwiML generation
python-dotenv: Environment variable management for secure configuration
uvicorn: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application
Infrastructure Requirements
